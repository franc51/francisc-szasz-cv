              Because being a mentor is my final goal, I believe that in
              addition to delivering exceptional technical expertise, my role
              should be centered around less experienced people in the team or
              people that have difficulties in the project so that I can help
              them become a better asset for the team. My wish is that when it
              finally comes the time to leave the team, I leave the team a
              better place than when I came.
